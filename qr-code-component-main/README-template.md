### What I learned

Laying down HTML is quick and simple but the CSS of it all is usually the headache for any web developer. But i managed to finally center the qr code:


```css
.sticker {
    background: #ffff;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    margin-top: 175px;
    display: block;
    height: 490px;
    width: 350px;
    padding-top: 25px;
    border-radius: 15px;
    text-align: center;
}
```

It's fairly simple code, but it was gratifying to finally get the positioning right.
